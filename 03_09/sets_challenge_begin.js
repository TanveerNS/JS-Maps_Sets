//Letters Guessed
//You are playing a game of snowman with a friend and keep track of
//letters that have been guessed using Set().
//Follow the tasks below to test your knowledge.

//1. So far, your friend has gussed the following letters: r, s, t, l, n, e.
//Create a Set using the letters guessed thus far.

//2. Your friend takes another guess: p. Before you add it to the set check
//to see if the Set has 'p'. If not, add it to the Set.

//3. At this point, we will assume your friend hasn't tried to guess the same letter twice.
//The size of the Set will indicate how many guesses he's made. How many guesses
//has your friend made?

//4. Delete the letter 'l' from your Set.

//5. What is the second value in your Set?

//6. What is the first entry in your Set?

//7. For each entry in your Set, log out whether the guess was a consonant or a vowel.
//This one is a little challenging!
const vowels = ["a", "e", "i", "o", "u"];

//8. Clear your Set!
